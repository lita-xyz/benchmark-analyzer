* v0.1.5
- fix bug which caused bad fits, due to passing the wrong DF into the
  functions performing fits
- adjust output file name for individual fit plots to be unique
- make sure the ~fit~ function receives as many starting parameters as
  the fit function needs
- improve look of facet plot of all fits
* v0.1.4
- set errors to 1 if only single sample of a benchmark and warn
- limit maximum number of function evals & warn if exceeded
* v0.1.3
- fix error bars in log plots (via dependencies)
* v0.1.2

  The first argument is always used for the main input. The second if it
  is given is used for the comparison benchmark. However, if only one
  input is given, it is used for both inputs.
- clean up the performance reporting (no more sample standard
  deviation by default & less confusing reporting)
- generates an Org table of the performance changes
* v0.1.1
- minor fix in printing of performance regressions (missing backtick)
- change language from "performance optimization" to "performance
  improvement"
- respect ~NO_COLOR~ environment variable following
  https://no-color.org/ to disable colored output  
* v0.1.0
- initial version with plots for individual metrics, fits against
  trace sizes and comparison for performance improvements / regressions
